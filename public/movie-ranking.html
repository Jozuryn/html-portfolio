<h1>The Best Movies According To Stephen</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>The movie that made me fall more in love with anime and it's art work.

</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Big fantasy fan. You can really see how much work and passion was put into the 
    development of characters and the world itself throughout each movie.
</p>
<h3>The Avengers</h3>
<p>Huge Marvel Universe fan. In my opinion, though, the movies have gone a bit 
    down in quality after "End Game".
